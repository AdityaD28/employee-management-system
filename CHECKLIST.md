## ðŸš€ How to Use This System

### For Beginners
1. Run `make setup` for complete initialization
2. Use `make dev-backend` and `make dev-frontend` to start development
3. Login with provided demo credentials
4. Explore employee management features
5. Try payroll processing via API

### For Developers
- Extend the system by adding new routes and models
- Use the testing framework to ensure quality
- Follow the established patterns for consistency
- Refer to the comprehensive README for guidance

### For Deployment
- Use Docker Compose for production deployment
- Configure environment variables for your setup
- Set up proper database backups and monitoring
- Use the CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

## ðŸ“Š System Statistics

- **Lines of Code**: ~3,000+ (backend) + ~1,500+ (frontend)
